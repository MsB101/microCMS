# microCMS
Rework with Classes

## NOTICE
This is in Development and <strong>NOT</strong> production ready. Contributors are welcome.

### WHY
Because the Micro-CMS is old and outdated, it's in need of a revamp, project is about 30% complete.
Wordpress is too big, too bulky and downright unsecure in many ways, the microCMS is not a revamped version of WordPress, it is rather a small version that can act like wordpress without all of the uneeded BS.

### WHEN
This revamp started in March of 2019

### INTENT
Same as the Micro-CMS, small footprint, easy to install, fast load, class based, extendable and modularized.
